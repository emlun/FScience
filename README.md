FrozenPepper's FScience Science Transfer Plugin for Kerbal Space Program

Fork of [FScience][spaceport] v0.2. Notable changes:

- Experiments are rendered inoperable after transferring data from them (but can
  still be cleaned by a lab module)
- Modified GUI layout: Experiments and containers now have one scroll box for
  each type
- Transfer button isn't shown if target is the same as source
- Duplicates won't be transferred unless target container accepts them
- Reset highlights when closing transfer GUI
